    "question": "A 62-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes and early-onset Alzheimer dementia was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) one week ago with sepsis. She was found to have Escherichia coli pyelonephritis, was treated with intravenous fluids and appropriate antibiotics, and slowly improved. However, today she developed recurrence of fever and confusion, and she also reports constant abdominal pain.\n\n\nHer current vital signs include a temperature of 38.5°C, a heart rate of 125 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96% while she receives 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. Her cardiac and lung sounds are normal. She grimaces with palpation of the abdomen, worst in the right upper quadrant.\n\n\nLaboratory testing yields the following results:\n\n\n\n\n|  | Patient value | Reference range |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Leukocyte count (per mm3) | 14,200 | 4500–11,000 |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dL) | 12.0 | 12.0–16.0 |\n| Hematocrit (%) | 36.0 | 36.0–46.0 |\n| Platelet count (per mm3) | 265,000 | 150,000–350,000 |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL) | 2.0 | 0.6–1.1 |\n| Bilirubin, total (mg/dL) | 1.2 | 0.3–1.0 |\n| Alkaline phosphatase (U/liter) | 160 | 30–120 |\n| Aspartate aminotransferase (U/liter) | 120 | 0–35 |\n| Alanine aminotransferase (U/liter) | 100 | 0–35 |\n\n\nAn abdominal ultrasound, performed one week ago, revealed a normal liver and biliary system. An upright abdominal radiograph is obtained today (figure).\n\n\nWhat is the most appropriate next imaging study for this patient?\nAnswer Choices: (A) Endoscopic ultrasound (B) Cholescintigraphy (C) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (D) Abdominal ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (E) Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography",

The patient denies chest pain but does note a mild chronic cough, which has been stable for years. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and his last exacerbation was 1 month ago and resolved with a course of oral glucocorticoids. The patient also had a myocardial infarction (MI) 9 years ago and underwent percutaneous angioplasty of his left anterior descending artery. Medications include a combined beta-2 agonist and anticholinergic inhaler, aspirin, rosuvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

She says that his first seizure occurred 1 year ago. Since then, he has been on valproic acid but the seizure activity remains unchanged. He was recently enrolled in daycare because she could no longer care for him full-time.
